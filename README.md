# Cab-Fare-Prediction
Cab Fare Prediction Model This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict cab fares based on features such as pickup/dropoff locations, datetime, passenger count, and more. The goal is to help cab service providers and users estimate the fare before booking a ride, improving transparency and decision-making.
